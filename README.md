## Where access?

You can access Exam Lab clicking [here](https://dfop02.github.io/exam-lab/main.html).

## What is Exam Lab?

First of all, the exams must be in english because most of then are not available on many languagues, so I understand that is important to study on the same language you'll do the exam.

You can access the site [here](https://dfop02.github.io/exam-lab/main.html), and start your studies for free where and when you want. All exams availables are stored in `assets/exams`. You can study by answing the questions randomly without worry about time and get correct answer immeadialy or you can study by simulate which has 90 minutes to beat 60 random questions from your selected exam and you only get the result at the end.

For now, only the simulate is available.
